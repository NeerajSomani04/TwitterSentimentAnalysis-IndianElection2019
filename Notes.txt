Below Questions can't be answered with our EDA -->

1) How many tweets happened starting 1 jan 2019 till election result day?
This is just the count of all tweets that we collected. This can't be done because I collected only 10,000 tweets per day.
3) From which country/location tweets were?  → this can’t be answered using twitterscraper package.
